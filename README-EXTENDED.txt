This is a clone of the orignal github repo for pi-gen with specific
steps for extending the build.

This will add things like:
- default password from raspberry to specific value
- add setup scripts
- to the touch ssh step so image enables ssh access

More setup to come.


Setup VM/Debian10
TODO

Basic steps to run:

sudo rm -rf deploy work
time sudo ./build.sh -c config
